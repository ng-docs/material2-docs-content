The types of rows that may be rendered are header, footer, and data rows. This document focuses on how the table tries to efficienctly render the data rows.</p><h2 class="docs-markdown-h2">Background</h2><p class="docs-markdown-p">Each table's template is defined as a set of row and column templates. The row template defines the template that should be rendered for a header, footer, or data row. The column templates include the cell templates that will be inserted into each rendered row.</p><p class="docs-markdown-p">Each data object may be rendered with one or more row templates. When new data in provided to the table, the table determines which rows need to be rendered. In order to be efficient, the table attempts to understand how the new list of rendered rows differs from the previous list of rendered rows so that it can re-use the current list of rendered rows if possible.</p><h2 class="docs-markdown-h2">Rendering</h2><p class="docs-markdown-p">Each time data is provided, the table needs to create the list of rows that will be rendered and keep track of which data object will be provided as context for each row. For each item in the list, this pair is combined into an object that uses the <code class="docs-markdown-code">RenderRow</code> interface. The interface also helps keep track of the data object's index in the provided data array input.</p><pre class="docs-markdown-pre"><code class="lang-ts docs-markdown-code"><span class="hljs-keyword">export</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">interface</span> RenderRow&lt;T&gt; {
  data: T;
  dataIndex: <span class="hljs-built_in">number</span>;
  rowDef: CdkRowDef&lt;T&gt;;
}
</code></pre><p class="docs-markdown-p">When possible, <code class="docs-markdown-code">RenderRow</code> objects are re-used from the previous rendering. That is, if a particular data object and row template pairing was previously rendered, it should be used for the new list as well. This makes sure that the differ can use check-by-reference logic to find the changes between two lists. Note that if a <code class="docs-markdown-code">RenderRow</code> object is reused, it should be updated with the correct data index, in case it has moved since last used.</p><p class="docs-markdown-p">Once the list of <code class="docs-markdown-code">RenderRow</code> objects has been created, it should be compared to the previous list of <code class="docs-markdown-code">RenderRow</code> objects to find the difference in terms of inserts/deletions/moves. This is trivially done using the <code class="docs-markdown-code">IterableDiffer</code> logic provided by Angular Core.</p><p class="docs-markdown-p">Finally, the table uses the list of operations and manipulates the rows through add/remove/move operations.</p><h2 class="docs-markdown-h2">Caching <code class="docs-markdown-code">RenderRow</code> objects</h2><p class="docs-markdown-p">Each <code class="docs-markdown-code">RenderRow</code> should be cached such that it is a constant-time lookup and retrieval based on the data object and row template pairing.</p><p class="docs-markdown-p">In order to achieve this, the cache is built as a map of maps where the key of the outer map is the data object and the key of the inner map is the row template. The value of the inner map should be an array of the matching cached <code class="docs-markdown-code">RenderRow</code> objects that were previously rendered.</p></div></body></html>
